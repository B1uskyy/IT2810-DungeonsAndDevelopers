# Dungeon & Developers

An application to explore the various functionalities and mechanics of the popular roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons. Where you can create your own character, explore the games classes, monsters, races and abilityscores!


## Features

#### Explore monsters
- You can explore the different monsters within D&D
    - View the monsters HP, and type
    - Filter by type search for specific monsters
    - Review monsters to assign them difficulties and notes
    - Add monsters to your dungeon

#### Dungeon
- View all saved monsters, and their combined HP. To know how difficult this dungeon would be

#### My character
- Explore the different races, classes, ability scores and equipment which you can assign to your character. With usefull information



## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: Provides a component-based structure for building interactive UIs.
- **TypeScript**: Enhances code reliability with static typing, making the application more maintainable.
- **TailwindCSS**: Allows for shorthand CSS styling inline, while also creating and using our own global styles.
- **Framer Motion**: Allows for animations that make the UI more personal and dynamic.
- **Lodash**: Offers utility functions, simplifying common tasks like debouncing.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Enables running JavaScript on the server, handling requests, and serving content.
- **Apollo Server**: Used to implement a GraphQL API, facilitating flexible data fetching for the frontend.
- **GraphQL**: Provides efficient querying of data, allowing clients to request exactly what they need.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, document-oriented format.


## Run Locally
Clone the project
Link: http://it2810-20.idi.ntnu.no/project2

```bash
  git clone https://git.ntnu.no/IT2810-H24/T20-Project-2
```


### Run the frontend


Go to the frontend folder

```bash
  cd frontend
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

### Run the backend


Go to the backend folder

```bash
  cd backend
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```

## Backend

This project uses a Node.js server where we're using Apollo server with GraphQL to interact with our database, which we chose to be MongoDB.

We chose MongoDB as our database because it was well documented, which made learning and implementing it easy. It is also ideal for our use we can store the same entities but with different attributes.

Having already decided on MongoDB and GraphQL for our technologies, we found Apollo to be a efficient and fitting server to use.
## GraphQL API

In this project, weâ€™ve implemented a GraphQL API. The API allows clients to query and mutate data related to D&D monsters, user information, races, and classes.


### Schema
In the GraphQL schema, we are defining the types of data that the client can query or mutate. We defined separate schemas for monsters, users, races, and classes to structure our data effectively.

### MongoDB models
We used Mongoose to define models that map our MongoDB documents to JavaScript objects. Each GraphQL schema type corresponds to a MongoDB model:

- Monster Model (monsterSchema): Stores monster information, including nested reviews.
- Class Model (ClassSchema): Represents different classes in the D&D universe.
- Race Model (RaceSchema): Stores race-specific information.
- User Model (playerSchema): Manages user information, including references to favorite monsters, class, and race.


### Resolvers
Resolvers are functions that handle GraphQL queries and mutations. We implemented resolvers to handle various operations for each type:

- **Queries**: Fetch data for monsters, users, classes, and races. Supports filtering and pagination.
- **Mutations**: Create and update records, including user registration, adding reviews to monsters, and managing favorite monsters.



### Use in frontend
To be able to use all this functionality we have defined multiple GraphQL queries and mutations in the frontend, by using Apollo Client.

## Tests

### E2E testing
For E2E testing we have used Cypress to simulate different user stories. We have made; 

- **Login.cy**: Tests login, searching, and user interaction with data
- **Filtering.cy**: tests login and filtering. 

To run the E2E tests you need a running frontend and backend, be in the frontend folder and run: 

```bash
  npx cypress open   
```

This should open an Cypress desktop where you need to navigate to E2E testing.
From here you can select the tests and watch as they are ran in a virtual desktop!



## D&D API

#### Specifications

We use the [D&D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) to fetch the different objects used for the page. Such at the different classes, monsters, equipment etc. Which helps us keep the page true to how D&D works and what is possible in the game.

## Accesability
For better accesability we have provided ARIA-labels for the essential elements for our code. 
Which helps us provide context for our custom elements, and provide information to assistive technologies.
